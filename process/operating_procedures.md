FOCUS Operating Procedures
## Introduction

  This document provides the working procedures used by the Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS) Project. The [project charter](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/foundation/blob/main/FOCUS_-_Membership_Agreement_Package_for_use.pdf) establishes the terms upon which this project operates. This operational proceedure document outlines how the members of the project adhere to these terms. Terms in this document do not override the Project Charter, if there is any ambiguity between this document and the [project charter](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/foundation/blob/main/FOCUS_-_Membership_Agreement_Package_for_use.pdf).

## Governance

### Membership

  All contributors to the FOCUS work products sign the [FOCUS Series Membership Agreement](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/foundation/blob/main/FOCUS_-_Membership_Agreement_Package_for_use.pdf).

  Membership is between FOCUS Project and the Employer of any contributing person.

### Organization Structure

![Org Structure](images/org_structure.png?raw=true "Org Structure")

#### Steering Committee
  
  The Steering Committee roles, responsibilities and processes are covered in [steering_committee.md](steering_committee.md).

#### Marketing Committee Team

  There will be no Marketing Committee within the FOCUS Project.
  Marketing and other Shared Services will be provided by the FinOps Foundation as the project’s funding sponsor.

#### FOCUS [Working] Groups (FG)

  FOCUS Working Groups are chartered by the SC to handle one or more Work Packages. 

  Each FOCUS Group may extend this operational proceedures with their own proceedures as long as they do not conflict or overrule any of the processes in this document or the [project charter](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/foundation/blob/main/FOCUS_-_Membership_Agreement_Package_for_use.pdf). Typically each FOCUS Group will work in its own Github repository or in a previously established Github repository within the FOCUS Project's GitHub Organization depending on the FOCUS Group's scope and deliverables. 

  A list of current and previous FOCUS Groups will be maintained in GitHub [focus_groups.md](focus_groups.md).

  We use the term FOCUS Working Group or FOCUS Group, or the abbreviation FG to refer to the FOCUS working groups in non-legal documentation. In CLAs, licenses and governance documents the term "Working Group". 

### Organization Roles

  Organizational Roles involved in performing work within the Project or as a member of a FOCUS Working Group are:

  * FOCUS Group members (FG member)
  * FOCUS Group Maintainer
  * FOCUS Group Chair(s)
  * Support Staff

#### FOCUS Group members (FG member)

  An FG member is any individual creating content or commenting on an issue or pull request.

  FG members MUST read the Project documentation (e.g.: this operational document, contribution guidelines, README, Contributing, and Release Planning documents) before attempting to submit an Issue or Pull Request

#### FOCUS Group Maintainer
  
  FG Maintainers are a subset of the FOCUS Group members who have been given write access to one or more FOCUS Working Group repositories within the FOCUS Project's Github organization. They will advance the day-to-day evolution of the specification and related work products.

  FG Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that the contents of documents and work products accurately reflect the decisions that have been made by the group, and that the specification adheres to formatting and content guidelines. 

  FG Chair(s) will designate a FG Maintainer or FG Maintainers for the FG. FG Maintainer(s) are overseen by of the FG Chair(s).

  The FG Maintainer(s) MUST keep the project documentation up to date (e.g.: contributing, readme and release planning documents).

  The FG Maintainer(s) MUST apply the "Review & Approval" process—covered in 6.1 of this document—to contributions submitted by the Working Group members.

  The FG Maintainer(s) SHOULD use GitHub Labels to indicate the type of “Review & Approval” assigned to each Pull Request.

  The FG Maintainer(s) SHOULD keep FOCUS project related communications with members  within GitHub using GitHub Issues or GitHub Pull Requests and corresponding GitHub comment functionality rather than one to one communications.

  The FG Maintainer(s) SHOULD close contributions that do not follow the rules, or meet the right quality or are related to features that are in the scope of the Release Version under development.

  If an FG is working in Hybrid Contribution mode where some edits are being made outside of GitHub, the FG Maintainer will be responsible for exporting Github content into a FG working document format, and the subsequent porting of that updated working document content back into GitHub content. All access to exported working documents will be limited to the members of the FOCUS group only, no external contributions are allowed.

  An FG may select a new FG Maintainer or FG Maintainers upon Approval of the FG members, with the approval of the FG’s Chair.

#### FOCUS Group Chair(s)

  Chair(s) are a subset of the FOCUS Group members and are responsible for organizing activities around work product(s) developed by the FG, including:
  
  * Developing

## Publication

### GitHub

Published releases of the FG outputs will be maintained on the `main` branch of the respective FG REPOs. Each merge on this branch will be [tagged](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/managing-tags) with a version following Symantic Versioning. A `releases.md` file will be maintained in the REPO to allow consumers of the FG outputs to determine what has changed and when releases occurred.

### Website Releases

Some releases may be converted to web friendly formats (such as, PDF, HTML) and made available via the website [focus.finops.org](https://focus.finops.org/). These releases will clearly attribute the ownership of the material to the FOCUS Project and make it easy to identify the version of the publication.

## Documentation

### Terminology and Conventions

#### Language

The default language for writing documentation is American English, English (United States).

#### Conventions

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Note: It is recommended to use the following terminology when writing Technical Specifications:

MUST: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

SHOULD: This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
MAY: This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", means that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.

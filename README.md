## What is FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS)?

The FOCUS Project will define and maintain a common, source-neutral, schema and related artifacts for cloud billing, cost, usage, and observability data with mappings to cloud service provider billing data and other common sources of cost and usage data. The specification of the common schema, mappings, metadata, associated reference implementations and use case descriptions will enable organizations to ingest and normalize cloud and related billing data in a way that is compatible with FinOps practices, KPIs and the FinOps Framework.

Project resources are provided by the [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org) Governing Board.
